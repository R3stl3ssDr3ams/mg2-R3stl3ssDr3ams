## Devlog
The plan made during class was not that much different to the one used in code, but given that I had not referenced our plan while coding, there were some conflicts I encountered before getting back to those conclusions. 
Spefically, I'd placed much of the coin's properties within the GameController script; this meant that not jsut instantiation, but translation was also being controlled by that script, which created an error where the clones 
of the coin wouldn't move alongside the original
